## Querying Multiple Tables

### Cartesian Product

the Cartesian product, which is every permutation of the two tables. Each row gets joined all rows fromthe second table.

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address FROM customer c JOIN address a;
```

### Inner Joins

This type of join is known as an inner join, and it is the most commonly used type of join. To clarify, if a row in the customer table has the value 999 in the
address_id column and thereâ€™s no row in the address table with a value of 999 in the address_id column, then that customer row would not be included in the result set.

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address FROM customer c JOIN address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id;
//If you do not specify the type of join, then the server will do an inner join by default.
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address FROM customer c INNER JOIN address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id;
```
### The ANSI Join Syntax
Another version of JOIN syntax
```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address FROM customer c, address a WHERE c.address_id = a.address_id;
```

### Joining Three or More Tables

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer c
INNER JOIN address a
ON c.address_id = a.address_id
INNER JOIN city ct
ON a.city_id = ct.city_id;

//order is not important 

SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, ct.city
FROM city ct
INNER JOIN address a
ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
INNER JOIN customer c
ON c.address_id = a.address_id;
```

### Using Subqueries as Tables
```sql

SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, addr.address, addr.city
FROM customer c
INNER JOIN
(SELECT a.address_id, a.address, ct.city
  FROM address a
  INNER JOIN city ct
  ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
  WHERE a.district = 'California'
  ) addr
  ON c.address_id = addr.address_id;

```
### Self-Joins

you can actually join a table to itself. This might seem like a strange thing to do at first, but there are valid reasons for doing so. Some tables include a self-referencing foreign key, which means that it includes a column that points to the primary key within the same table.


```sql
SELECT f.title
 FROM film f
 INNER JOIN film f_prnt
 ON f_prnt.film_id = f.prequel_film_id
 WHERE f.prequel_film_id IS NOT NULL;
```
